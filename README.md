In this analysis, we explored the performance of schools based on various factors such as spending per student, school size, and school type. We calculated several key metrics for each school and categorized them into different groups to better understand the factors that influence academic performance.

Performance Based on Spending per Student:
We first categorized schools into spending ranges per student and calculated the following key metrics for each range:

Average Maths Score
Average Reading Score
Percentage Passing Math
Percentage Passing Reading
Overall Passing Rate

We observed that schools with lower spending per student tend to have better academic performance. This is evident from the higher average math and reading scores, as well as a higher overall passing rate in schools with lower spending per student.

Performance Based on School Size:
Next, we grouped schools by their size and calculated similar key metrics for each size category. The size categories were defined as small, medium, and large schools based on the number of students.

We found that smaller schools tend to outperform larger ones in terms of average math and reading scores and overall passing rates. This suggests that smaller class sizes and more personalized attention may contribute to better academic performance.

Performance Based on School Type:
Lastly, we analyzed school performance based on school type, categorizing schools into "Charter" and "District." We calculated the same key metrics as in the previous analyses.

Our analysis revealed that charter schools consistently outperform district schools across all key metrics. Charter schools have higher average math and reading scores, a higher percentage of students passing math and reading, and a higher overall passing rate.

Conclusions:

Based on our analysis, we can draw two key conclusions:

Lower Spending Per Student Leads to Better Academic Performance: Schools with lower spending per student tend to have better academic performance. This suggests that financial resources should be allocated effectively, with an emphasis on quality teaching and support, rather than excessive spending.

Smaller Schools Outperform Larger Ones: Smaller schools, with smaller class sizes and more personalized attention, tend to achieve better academic results. This highlights the importance of class size and individualized instruction in improving student performance.

Additionally, our analysis demonstrates that charter schools outperform district schools, indicating the potential benefits of charter school models in achieving better academic outcomes.

Overall, these findings provide insights into the factors that influence school performance and can guide educational policies and resource allocation to enhance the quality of education in local government areas.
